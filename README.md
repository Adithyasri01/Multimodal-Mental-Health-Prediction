# 📱 Multi-Modal Sentiment Analysis for Predicting Mental Health Trends

## 🧾 Overview
This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, and data fusion to analyze social media posts. It aims to identify sentiment patterns that correlate with mental health indicators like anxiety, depression, and stress at a population level.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Extract sentiment from text, images, and post behavior.
- Fuse multi-modal features into a unified deep learning model.
- Visualize trends and detect potential mental health crises early.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Transformers (BERT)**, **TextBlob**, **VADER**
- **CNNs (ResNet/MobileNet)** for image sentiment
- **Fusion models** using attention layers
- **Dash/Plotly** for trend dashboard
